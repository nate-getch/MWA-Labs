1. Why do we want sometimes to use setImmidate instead of setTimeout?
When we want to schedule the immediate execution of callback after I/O events callbacks and before setTimeout and setInterval. Timers are based on a time in the future, even if it's 0, while check immediate is always on the next turn of the loop. 

setImmediate callbacks are called after I/O Queue callbacks are finished or timed out. 

2. process.nextTick vs setImmidate?
process.nextTick is not part of the event loop. It is executed with priority having been placed in nextTick queue.
setImmediate callbacks are placed in Check phase of the event loop, and executed after the next turn of the loop.
